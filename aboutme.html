                 <p>
                I am a self-taught email developer and designer 
                <br>
                with a real passion for creating responsive emails 
                <br>
                and websites. For the past two years, I have been 
                <br>
                focused on learning and improving my skills every
                <br>
                day. I truly love what I do, and I am always 
                <br>
                excited to keep learning and getting better.
                <br>
                <br>

                I pay close attention to detail and work hard to
                <br>
                deliver high-quality results. I always aim to 
                <br>
                make sure every project not only meets but goes
                <br>
                beyond expectations. To me, great design is 
                <br>
                about more than just how it looks it is about 
                <br>
                creating a smooth and enjoyable experience for
                <br> 
                the user.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am really excited about the chance to work
                <br> 
                with you and create something amazing 
                <br>
                together. Lets chat and see how we can bring 
                <br>
                your ideas to life!
